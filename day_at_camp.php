        	<h1>A Day at Camp</h1>
	 <p><img class="intext_right" src="photos/kaolackcamp_001_200.jpg" width="200" />Each day is based on a certain theme, and as the week progresses, girls are exposed to topics such as Identity, Health/Fitness, Gender and Development, Environment, Communication, and Business. The themes are carefully planned to provide campers with an overall understanding of personal well-being, teamwork, leadership, and gender and development issues. Throughout the week, girls are divided into teams which rotate through activities to ensure that every girl has individual attention, interacts with a consistent group of people to develop close relationships, and gets the chance to experience every activity available at the camp. The following schedule is an example of what a day at camp might look like:</p>
	 
	<p>
    <table><tbody>
	<tr><td width="100px">7-8am</td><td>Wake Up</td></tr>
	<tr><td>08:00 - 08:30</td><td>Breakfast on the water, consisting of locally produced jam, coffee, butter, and bread.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8:30-9am</td><td>Journal Entering</td></tr><tr><td>9-10am</td><td>Leadership and team building sessions, Egg Toss, Egg Race, Water Balloon Toss, Trust Falls, etc.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>10-11am</td><td>Nutrition Session. Go over food groups, and examples of local foods that fall under each category.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>11-12pm</td><td>Personal Hygiene Session. Girls have the chance to discuss common practices in Senegal, analyze best practices, and learn to apply the information to which they are presented.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>12-1pm</td><td>Lunch break on the water. Local dishes are served thanks to the amazing kitchen staff!</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1-2pm</td><td>Afternoon nap, an integral part of any Senegalese day.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2-3pm</td><td>Crafts/Activities. Make Moringa Beignets and include a discussion on the benefits of local moringa tree, and how to integrateit into common dishes. Followed by activity where girls make the beignets, a local favorite which resembles American doughnut holes which contain grounded Moringa leaves.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3-4pm</td><td>Neem Lotion Demonstration. Neem is another local tree, the benefits of which include repellent properties. Malaria carrying mosquitoes are adverse to the scent of neem, and a lotion can easily be produced using neem leaves, which work as an insect repellent, thus preventing the spread of malaria.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4-5pm</td><td>Afternoon break and snack. Snack includes peanuts, beignets made in earlier sessions, mangoes, etc.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5-6pm</td><td>Free time and sports. During this time, girls learn to swim, play softball, play soccer, or pursue other activities led by counselors.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7-8pm</td><td>Dinner time. Local foods are again served by the kitchen staff, with girls sitting in groups of 5-6 along with a volunteer or counselor.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8-9pm</td><td>During this hour, girls meet up in small groups with their Senegalese counselors. The counselors are local women who work as teachers, and have offered a week of their time to work with and inspire campers, providing a real life example of a successful Senegalese woman.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>9-10pm</td><td>Spa night! During this time, fun activities are designed around the day’s theme. For example, during personal well-being day, girls had a spa night where they learned to give back massages, do manicures and pedicures, and did each other’s’ hair and makeup. Other nights included a movie and popcorn night, campfire with S’mores  (a wholly American concept) night, and a night of skits performed by each group.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>10-11</td><td>After the evening’s activity, girls are escorted back to their cabins, and have time to get ready for bed. Lights out is at 11pm, so that everyone is ready for another fun day of camp in the morning!</td></tr>
