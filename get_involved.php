<h1>Get Involved</h1>

<p><img src="photos/kaolackcamp_003_200.jpg" class="intext_left" width="200" />Camp de Connaissance et Croissance is made possible by donations from friends and family back home. We ask for your support, and appreciate any donation you can make! By doing so, you are able to provide more girls with an amazing experience which will have a significant impact on her life. Because many families cannot afford to send their daughters, we offer scholarships based on academic standing and achievements for girls ages 15-16 to be able to attend.</p>

<p>Your donation is tax deductible and 100 percent of your contribution goes towards the camp community project.</p>

<p>Camp de Connaissance et Croissance is funded through the Peace Corps Partnership Program (PCPP) which links interested donors to the needs of developing communities in which Peace Corps Volunteers serve. The program does not directly fund projects, but serves as a linkage between individuals, groups, and organizations wishing to contribute to volunteer work within our communities. Since its establishment in 1964, the PCPP has connected thousands of community-led Peace Corps initiatives with interested groups and individuals searching to contribute to fulfilling the needs of developing communities worldwide.</p>
