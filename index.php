	 <p><img alt="and another here" class="intext_right" src="photos/IMG_2644.png" width="223px">Thank you to everyone who made <em>Camp de Connaissance et Croissance 2010</em> a great success! We thank all of the donors, Peace Corps volunteers, local teachers, and especially the campers for turning our simple idea of a leadership camp for girls, into the experience of a lifetime for the 40 young women who participated. Check out our <a href="photos.php">photo page</a> to see for yourself!</p>
	 
	 <p><em>Camp de Connaissance et Croissance</em> is a week-long leadership development program for girls just finishing their <em>cinqui√®me</em> year of school. Through an interview process, we select those girls who show leadership ability, motivation, and a strong desire to pursue their dreams. We aspire to empower and inspire girls from central Senegal to become strong and independent community leaders who have a positive impact on their communities. By meeting other girls their own age from a wide range of backgrounds and communities, we aim to provide summer camp memories that can serve as inner resources for each participant throughout her life.</p>
	 
	 <p>By providing this experience, we hope to open participants' eyes to opportunities in regards to traditional norms and expectations. Girls in Senegal are less likely to receive encouragement to excel academically and to pursue their goals because of social pressure to marry early. This weeklong camp is an opportunity for forty girls from twelve different communities to learn how to achieve their full potential.</p>
	 
	 <p><img alt="Photo here" class="intext_left" src="photos/writing.jpg" width="200px">Through a variety of workshops, games, and other activities these girls are able to recognize that they have the agency to set and achieve their own goals. They will discuss topics such as health, career options, environmental protection, and gender roles. The girls will also meet successful women whom they can look up to as role models. Women from the local teachers' union act as counselors, and facilitate daily discussion sessions in small groups to address issues that girls face in their daily lives. In addition, women in other career fields will participate as guest speakers to allow the girls to understand fully their options in life. In only one week, we hope to give every participant an experience which will stay with her for a lifetime. We work hard to ensure that every girl says goodbye at the end of the week with increased self-confidence, improved communication skills, a greater capacity for leadership, lifelong friendships, and higher self-esteem.</p>
	 
	 <p>The chance to provide the young women of Senegal with this opportunity is entirely reliant upon grants, donations, and the hard work of local volunteers. We appreciate any donation you can afford and invite you to check out our photos, testimonials, and detailed camp information. Thank you for your interest, and as they say here in Senegal, Bismillah!</p>
